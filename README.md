# foodieClub - Frontend

foodieClub project portfolio has been created for educational purposes only as the 5th project in the Code Instituteâ€™s full stack development program.

Using the principles of UX design and the agile development methodology, this project was developed using React that handles all the frontend functionality including user profiles, posts, comments, likes, bookmark posts, add recipes to posts, followers, authentication, authorization and more.

foodieClub is an application where users can create their own online posts about their favorite food, there a funtionality to add recipes to the post while also being able to see the posts and recipes of other users. Via commenting and likes the users can engage with each other and share their recommendations.

Please note, this project is fairly similar to the walkthrough project Moments of Code Institute as I used that as baseline due the complextity of this new front-end library. I have tried to customize this project as much as possible within the timeline I had.

# Flowchart

Flowchart was created before I created the project, which gave me an idea of which user has access to which page and what each link should be doing.

To accomplish this I used [LucidChart](https://lucid.co/).

## Agile Methodology

The principles of agile methodology were utilized during the project. By assigning user stories to issues and taking advantage of the GitHub Kanban board functionality, the necessary goals and priorities throughout the project could be well defined. In addition, labels were used to further define the priority of each user story in the Kanban board.

# Testing

I have included testing details in a separate document called [Testing.md](./docs/testing.md)

## Deployment

Git and GitHub are used for version control. React.js is the frontend language, and can't be displayed with GitHub alone, To live preview my project, I used Heroku.

## Deployment to Heroku

### 1. Create your Heroku app
* Navigate to the Heroku website
* Create a Heroku account by entering your email address and a password (or login if you have one already).
* Activate the account through the authentication email sent to your email account
* Click the **new button** on the top right corner of the screen and select create a new app from the dropdown menu.
* Enter a unique name for the application.
* Select the appropriate region for the application.
* Click create app
* In the Heroku dashboard click on the Resources tab
* Scroll down to Add-Ons, search for and select 'Heroku Postgres' / Now replaced by 'ElephantSQL'
* In the Settings tab, scroll down to 'Reveal Config Vars' and add the `DATABASE_URL` as key, the value should be the ElephantSQL database url you just copied.

### 3. Heroku Final Deployment

1. In the 'Deployment method' section select 'Github' and click the 'connect to Github' button to confirm.
2. In the 'search' box enter the Github repository name for the project
3. Click search and then click connect to link the heroku app with the Github backend repository. The box will confirm that heroku is connected to the repository.
4. In 'manual deploy' section, click 'deploy branch'
5. Once the build log is finished it will show open app button, click there to see deployed app.
