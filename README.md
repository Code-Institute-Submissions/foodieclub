# foodieClub - Frontend

foodieClub project portfolio has been created for educational purposes only as the 5th project in the Code Instituteâ€™s full stack development program.

Using the principles of UX design and the agile development methodology, this project was developed using React that handles all the frontend functionality including user profiles, posts, comments, likes, bookmark posts, add recipes to posts, followers, authentication, authorization and more.

foodieClub is an application where users can create online posts about their favorite food, with functionalities to add recipes, like, leave comments, and bookmark favorite posts; while also being able to see different posts and recipes from other users. Through these functionalities, they will be able to engage with the App community.

Please note, this project is fairly similar to the walkthrough project Moments of Code Institute as I used that as baseline due the complextity of this new front-end library. I have tried to customize this project as much as possible within the timeline I had.

## Agile Methodology

The principles of agile methodology were utilized during the project. By assigning user stories to issues and taking advantage of the GitHub Kanban board functionality, the necessary goals and priorities throughout the project could be well defined. In addition, labels were used to further define the priority of each user story in the Kanban board.

## Design

The theme for the project is intended to target people who love food - professional and nonprofessional. This is a social media platform where users can interact through their posts, exchange ideas for recipes, and meet new people through the user experience.
    
- Colors  
The main colours are overall white, black and red; it blends well with the App layout and content.
- Font  
The fonts in the theme are clear and modern and contribute perfectly to the overall look of the site.  
- Images  
The images and logo in the theme provide great content to the site; as the user navigates through the pages, it reassures them of what this application intends to do.

## Deployment

This project was created on GitHub and edited in GitPod by carrying out the following:

* A new repository was created without a template
* Name you new repository as per your project name and select 'Create Repository'
* I opened the repository on GitHub then clicked the 'Gitpod' button to build the GitPod workspace which would allow me to build and edit the code used to make my app.
* Version control was used throughout the project using the following commands in the terminal using Bash
* git add . or git add "file name" - to stage the changes and get them ready for being committed to the local repo.
* git commit -m "Description of the update" - to save the change and commit the change to the local repo
* git push - to push all committed changes to the GitHub
* commit --amend - for changing the wording or spelling of the most recent commit
* git reset "commit hash"
* git config pill.rebase true > git pull > git push was used when I could not push my code due an error, this put changes to one side, pull the code from Github, and then reapply my changes on top.

## Deployment to Heroku

Some of the deployment steps below are specifically required for this project and may not be applicable to older versions, or different projects.

Before deploying to Heroku I created the Procfile with web: serve -s build

This project was deployed to Heroku using the following steps:

## Create your Heroku app

* Navigate to the Heroku website
* Create a Heroku account by entering your email address and a password (or login if you have one already).
* Activate the account through the authentication email sent to your email account
* Click the **new button** on the top right corner of the screen and select create a new app from the dropdown menu.
* Enter a unique name for the application.
* Select the appropriate region for the application.
* Click create app
* Navigate to the deployment tab of your new app, look for Deployment method' section select 'Github' and click the 'connect to Github' button to confirm.
* In the 'search' box enter the Github repository name for the project
* Click search and then click connect to link the heroku app with the Github backend repository. The box will confirm that heroku is connected to the repository.
* In 'manual deploy' section, click 'deploy branch'
* Once the build log is finished it will show open app button, click there to see deployed app.

### Forking the GitHub repo

If you want to make changes to the repo without affecting it, you can make a copy of it by 'Forking' it. This will make sure that the original repo remains unchanged.

<ol>
    <li>Log in to your GitHub account</li>
    <li>Navigate to the repository <a href="https://github.com/henryl74/foodieclub" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a></li>
    <li>Select the 'Fork' button in the top right corner of the page (under your account image)</li>
    <li>The repo has now been copied into your own repos and you can work on it in your chosen IDE</li>
    <li>If you have any suggestions to make regards to the code to make the site better, you can put in a pull request</li>
</ol>

### Cloning the repo with GitPod

<ol>
    <li>Log in to your GitHub account</li>
    <li>Navigate to the Repository <a href="https://github.com/henryl74/foodieclub" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a></li>
    <li>Select the 'Code' button above the file list on the right had side</li>
    <li>Ensure HTTPS is selected and click the clipboard on the right of the URL to copy it</li>
    <li>Open a new workspace in GitPod</li>
    <li>In the bash terminal type 'git clone [copy url here from step 4]'</li>
    <li>Press enter - the IDE will clone and download the repo</li>
</ol>

### Download and extract the zip directly from GitHub

<ol>
    <li>Log in to your GitHub account</li>
    <li>Navigate to the Repository <a href="https://github.com/henryl74/foodieclub" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a></li>
    <li>Select the 'Code' button above the file list on the right had side</li>
    <li>Select 'Download Zip'</li>
    <li>Once you have the Zip downloaded, open it with your prefered file decompression software</li>
    <li>You can then drag and drop the files from the folder into your chosen IDE or view/edit them on your local machine</li>
    <li>If you want to create a web-app from the repo please follow the instructions in "Project Deployment"</li>
</ol>
